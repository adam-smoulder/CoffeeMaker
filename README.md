# CoffeeMaker
automated coffee maker project files. See TODO file for status and stuff that's in progress.


The goal of this project is to be ultimately able to open an app on my phone, enter a number of cups of coffee, hit go, then arrive at Pitt's engineering hall 20 minutes later to find my designated amount of coffee prepared. This has a few "subprojects" that need to coincide for total functionality:
1. Wifi communication (ESP8266 with hacked "router" on PittNet, use Blynk for phone)
2. Water dispersion (Arduino, servo motor pressing tap on 10gal jug)
3. Coffee dispensing (Arduino, dc motor with rotating windmill-type mechanism + rumble on sides of container to prevent clogging, hole in top of coffee maker to receive)
4. Turning on coffee pot (Arduino, relay circuit)
5. Remove/replace filter (Reusable filter attached to ground-loading console, robotic arm removes console, removes grounds, puts back in)
